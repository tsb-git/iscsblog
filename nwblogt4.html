						  Puja takes place during the Aswin month of
Bengali calendar , usually either in the October or
end September in English calendar. But this time it is
something different. As per Bengali almanac the month
Aswin is denoted as an inauspicious month(malmas)
when any sort of auspicious work is prohibited. In the
dawns of Mahalayas the Bengalees are used to listen
to Mahisasuramardini- the programme welcoming
Durgapuja with the note Aswiner Sarada prate beje
uthechhe alokmanjari (Puja mornings in Aswin month
tinkle with luminosity )in the voice of Birendra Krishna
Bhadra broadcast from All India Radio station. With
Mahalaya the counting of puja days start though there is
no scriptural link to it. However, some contraventions
are found at times. In 1982 same thing happened, puja
came late by more than a month after Mahalaya. In
fact , one can get the scent of Durgapuja from the sky,
from the air of Bengal and feel that the Durga puja is
approaching. The natural surroundings get remarkably
changed. The air carrying the fragrance of Siuli flower,
the sky having the floating bunch of ethereal cloud
and the catkins in villages inform that puja is coming.
Something is wrong but this time, that atmosphere is
foiled either may be of Corona Pandemic or because
of late arrival of puja after Mahalaya. Catkins are
certainly blooming , fragfrance of siuli is around, the
natural atmosphere of autumn even in rain peeps in but
we are having mental problem to come out from last
six months’ corona spell. From that point of view the
situation is really something unprecedented.
History reveals that Bengal’s own festival Durgotsav
remained untarnished even in the face of various
calamities in past also but there was no compromise
with puja that was observed in a grand manner, if not
incapable at all. This time also we do hope that the
Durgotsav will be observed after following due strict
health guidelines.
Let’s turn the pages of history to review such cases
in past .</b>
                         </p>
						  <p class="excert"><b>
In the monthly Magazine Basumati while writing a
serial under the title Puratan Panjika (the old Almanac)
Rasaraj Amritalal Basu, the famous theatre personality,
had nicely explained the Bengalee psychology that
dictated to celebrate the festival in a grand fashion on
the occasion of Durgapuja. He labeled Durgapuja as
Bengal’s ethnic festival and elaborated some aspects in
his excellent style of narration.
Durgotsab is Bengal’s ethnic festival. This is like being
immersed during the monsoon Bengalees wipe their
entire bodies in Aswin and put on new clothes to get
engaged in the work of new life. Bengalees welcome the
Mahashakti (super power) in the name of Anandamoyee
in Aswin month and place her in the hearts of their own
families. Bengalees are not satisfied just to prostrate on
the ground imagining their parents staying afar in the
void and in formless form. Rather they like to instill
life of Mother in the idol and place her in a Mandap.
Imagining the dear daughter residing at the house of
her husband coming to her Father’s house they become
emotional out of joy.
The gist is that Mother Durga is not only Devi to
Bengalees but also daughter of the house. So she is
named Uma. Amritalal says, Bengalees never give any
importance to the obstacles in the face of puja. Obstacles
may come, still the home coming of the daughter is
always welcome, whatever may be the means. The most
important matter is she is coming back to her own
home. In those days the storms during Sept-Oct were
very famous in Kolkata and historical evidences are
there that the public life used to be devastated because
of the storms. Naturally that affected also Durgapuja.
This time also we faced Amphan during May. Since there
is a reasonable gap with the puja month this is under
control now. But the natural calamity during Sept -Oct
month just before puja did seldom give any chance to
control the situation. There is a big and abnormal hike
in the price of everything during the puja time when
everything in general is costly. The abnormal high price
did create trouble earlier, that tradition continues till
today. But even amidst the loss and destruction because
of the storm the festive spirit of Bengalees did never get
hampered. In fact , Bengalees did not allow the note of
sorrow to destroy the mood of festivity.
This severe Aswin tempest sank down so many ships,
razed to the ground so many houses but not a single hay
of the festive hut of Bengal did move.</b>

                        <p class="excert"><b>
                         The situation is not much changed now in comparison
to the situation of the society then.The high price during
puja time makes life miserable even today. Shri Amritlal
gave an account how the situation made people enjoying
the puja celebration troublesome due to natural calamity
and exactly at what ratio was the price hike.
After three years in the month of Kartick since the
storm came in the night it killed many people of Calcutta
though it was not that much severe in the month of
Aswin. On the one hand it was for puja marketing time
and on the other hand the outbreak of storm, the prices
of all the goods rose up high. You will be surprised
hearing that the cost of good quality Balam rice was
more than Rs. 3/ per maund. The full grown Ruhi fish
cost 6 annas even7 annas thus the hike in price was
such that people suffered a lot. Families with 8 to10
members having earning of Rs.40/per month while
managed earlier even to afford another 2 people staying
at their places for 2/3 days were put in trouble. Only
the hut -builders, masons, labourers, and the owners of
ships carrying cargos were benefitted. The ships costing
Rs 2/or Rs 3/ per day rose to Rs. 80-90 and not dropped
under Rs.40-60 till one year.
Still people could take the abnormal expenses as
something usual and used to arrange for celebration
of puja at their level best. Though the time is changed
today but the habit of Bengalees is, I doubt, not changed.
However, there is a basic and qualitative difference
between the association of people in Durgapuja in those
days and today. The impact of Baro Yari Puja was not
then that much as it is today.
In 1909 Sanatan Dharmarakshini Sava started first
Baro yari Puja in Bhawanipore at Kolkata and post 25
years this Baro Yari Puja was not in popular practice.
But today the scenario is different where the basic fear
is more chances of more people getting infected by
corona virus due to puja gathering resulting ultimately
to uncontrollable wide spread of the disease. In earlier
days there was no pomp and grandeur in Baro Yari Puja
so there was no fear of spreading any contagious disease
centering puja. There was restriction in entry for public
at the pujas of aristocratic houses. So there was no link
between puja and epidemic. At least this is certain that
then the administration did least bother. The scenario
of villages used to be something different. Pujas in the
houses became the meeting place to enjoy the festivity.
As a result, when in 1918 Spanish Flu after Mumbai did
affect Kolkata people that lasted till 1920 ,the puja in
October month at Kolkata continued without a break
inspite of the sudden violent outbreak of the flu in the
month of October1919. The Baro Yari pujas of Kolkata
were not concomitant to it. No doubt, there was some
effect on in house pujas but no historical record of
discontinuation of puja is found. We have idea about
plague at local levels. We have the history of death of
countless people that almost depopulated Boral village
in south 24 parganas in 1867 due to malaria. Rajnarayan
Basu depicted the picture in his ‘Gramya Upakhyan’ ,
but he wrote nothing on its effect on Durgapuja . During
that time the well off people of Boral village shifted to
some other places. We can assume that Durgapujas
of those families were discontinued, but no historical
evidence is available to that effect. There are instances
of bleakness in the villages due to cholera , that affected
puja also, still people somehow could ultimately manage
to overcome those fleeting disasters. Shri Tulsidas Basu
of the Basu family , first inhabitant of Boral village came
again to live with his family and the puja that started,
has been continuing thenceforth till today. We are not
getting any data, any record, any evidence, any instance
even orally that Durgapuja was totally stopped at any
place only because of plague or epidemic. It might have
so happened that pujas were stopped in a particular
area for a certain time in some villages or Muffasils.</b>
                        </p>
						<p class="excert"><b>
                         Though,in Calcutta the fact was something different
in times of Spanish Flu. Calcutta Durga Pujas , controlled
by the aristocratic houses of wealthy people used to
showcase the standard of their prosperity at that time.
Recently Rwiju Basu has written an article in Ananda
Bazar Patrika describing the new norms will be followed
like use of mask and sanitization by the organizers of
200years age old Durga pujas. People were not so
much health conscious 100 years before. The rules by
doctors were also not so strict. During the spread of
Spanish Flu and even before that there was no Baro
Yari Puja as such, hence the question of infecting others
during puja did not arise. But now, the aristocratic
houses, organising Durga Pujas are planning to control
the entries of the outsiders .They did take same step in
similar situation 100 years before, revealed the family
members of some houses though no written document
is available exactly what steps were taken.</b>
                        </p>
						<p class="excert"><b>
                         We all know that post second world war, independence
of Bharat and the blow of the division of the country
distorted the foundation of Bengalee families, specially
of East Bengal . As a whole this is the one tragic history
of Bengalee. At some places in East Bengal people were
deprived of this festivity fervor for ever. But if we analyse
the entire history we can accept this as an exception.
Anyway, the people of East Bengal then suffered pain
for leaving their native land on the one hand and on
the other hand their inability to perform puja any longer
in the land of their past fourteen generations. People
in Calcutta were celebrating Durgapuja in a grand
way whereas the ever bubbling, sparkling courtyards
in East Bengal stood dark, unlighted. This inexorable
significant picture was portrayed in words on 19th Oct,
1950 in the Editorial column of Yugantar, where the
duality of Bengal was aptly sketched.
Calcutta, the great city is full of joy because of
Durgotsav ,the grandest festival of Bengal’s communal
life .Thousands and thousands of male and female, boysgirls,
have gathered and are swarming on the streets,
in the narrow lanes and bye lanes. Each and every day
of the whole of the year is wrapped with the need, the
pain. Children of Bengal get the sense of relief at least
for these 3 -4 days being free from that monotonous
sorrowful torture .Seeing the bright faces of family the
guardians feel satisfied. New tides come in businesses,
work centers even in literature and newspaper circles
due to Durgapuja. In a word, almost all people in
Bengal save few unfortunates, wait for these puja days.
So looking at the resounding celebration, illumination
with lights and the brightness of the capital city like the
conjugal night of the bride and groom we extend our
good wishes and greetings to the people ,delirious with
joy. We hope that our social life will be healthy , bright
and beautiful one day as it is now.</b>

						<p class="excert"><b>
                         Where is that glitter of gold in the lives of East
Bengal taday? Where is the newly bloomed hope and
| 22
|
dream in the Saradiya festival? Where is that resonance
in the strings of Golden harp? Today that lotus –forest
is afflicted by communal disturbances. The altar of
worship is abandoned. The villages are as quiet as
cremation ground. Only the howling of jackals and
barking of dogs can be heard in the night times but
during day times the cackling of children, the sounds of
the bangles of quiet village maids are lost in the shriek.
The terror stricken women are fleeing , the youths are
asylum seeker, and the old people are almost dead. That
huge Hindu society of East Bengal now in tents, in
fields as unidentified, friendless, kinless can be found
at Bihar, Odissa, Madras, Mysore or in Andaman. No
one is left to light up the lamp in the land of their past
fourteen generations. No mother is awaiting her son,
no wife is awaiting her husband no one is awake till
the night in those dreamless villages. There is no one
left who can worship. Bramhins, Priests, blacksmiths,
potters, all have fled. The large society is now landless,
seeker of asylum. The penniless and robbed of middle
class are but heaving deep, weary sighs in puja days
thinking of their predecessors. We know that tears
rolling in the eyes of numerous family members- Durga
, symbol of power will not be invoked. No chanting
of slokas for fame, life, prosperity, success will be
there in the Mandaps. Devi Durga, herself is seeking
shelter today. Being landless, so many families of East
Bengal have stopped celebrating puja today. They are
roaming around like the lost case with the ration card.
Their present with the glorious past is enveloped with
tremendous sorrow, while the future is under the veil of
darkness.
Until and unless ousted as in the above portrayal,
history reveals that Bengalees never failed to organize
their own Durgotsav, an ethnic festival, in spite of
hundreds of obstacles.
This time presumably Corona situation will not be
an exception.
However, please abide by the health rules as laid
down by the Government. Be healthy, be elated.</b>
