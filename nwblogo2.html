						The beginning of 2021 heralded the beginning of
a significant geo-political step towards reconciliation
among the Gulf Arab nations and Egypt. The three-anda-
half-year estrangement between Qatar and the four
Arab states – Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and UAE
– appears to have ended, when the Qatari Emir Sheikh
Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani was invited to attend the
41st annual Summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council
[GCC], held on 5th January, 2021, at the Saudi Arabian
city of Al-Ula. The six-country regional organization
Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC], comprising Bahrain,
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE,
was founded in 1981. The reconciliation effort, led
by Kuwait and Oman, with the Gulf leaders signed a
“solidarity and stability” agreement, the Qatari Emir
tweeted - “I participated, alongside our brothers, in the
Al-Ula summit to heal the rift, and we all hope for a
better future for the region. I thank the brothers in the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the generous reception,
and I thank the State of Kuwait for its valued efforts.”
There was strong American pressure to resolve the
impasse and the presence of Jared Kushner, President
Trump’s son-in-law and Adviser, at the Al-Ula Summit confirm the American role. The USA’s priority is to keep
the GCC together and consolidate a common front
against Iran. Qatar was paying large sums of money to
Iran for use of its airspace for flights.</b>

						  <p class="excert"><b>
In June 2017, Qatar and the four Arab nations
-Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE -fell out over
serious policy differences on support for the Muslim
Brotherhood, aiding and arming opposing factions in
the ongoing civil war in Libya and Syria and the critical
editorial slant of the Qatar-owned Al Jazeera media
group. Suspicions were also raised by Qatar’s friendly
relations with Iran, a major player in the regional
power struggle with Saudi Arabia and her Gulf allies.
These differences first emerged after uprisings in Arab
countries which were triggered by the public revolt in
Tunisia in December 2010, popularly referred to as the
“Arab Spring”. The differences were serious enough for
the three GCC countries and Egypt to cut off ties and
mount air, land and sea blockade of Qatar, a peninsula
that juts out into the Gulf from the Arabian landmass
and has a land border only with Saudi Arabia.</b>

                         Qatar is the richest country in the world based
on per capita income and the USA’s Bahrain-based
CENTCOM’s forward headquarter, is based at the Al-U airbase in Qatar. Apart from reaching out to the USA,
Qatar also invited Turkey to open a military base for
training purposes to mitigate the pressure mounted by
the blockade. Saudi Arabia and her other Arab allies
vehemently objected to the Turkish military base, one
among 13 demands placed before Qatar. Turkey has
spread its wings in the region, in its ambitious quest
for leadership of the Islamic world, challenging Saudi
Arabia’s traditional leadership. Bahrain and Qatar
have scrapped over their maritime boundary with each
country accusing the other of infringement. Turkey
has been a strong supporter of Islamist organizations
like the Muslim Brotherhood. Qatar had weathered
the blockade and it was not serving any purpose and
crossed its expiry date.

                        </p><p class="excert"><b>
                         The Iranian Foreign Minister in a sarcastic tweet
said: “Congratulations to Qatar for the success of its
brave resistance to pressure & extortion; To our other
Arab neighbours: Iran is neither an enemy nor threat.
Enough scapegoating – especially with your reckless
patron on his way out. Time to take our offer for a
strong region.” The Turkish foreign office said: “The
expression of common will to resolve the Gulf dispute
and the announcement of restoration of diplomatic
relations with Qatar… is a welcome development; “We
hope that the Al Ula Declaration signed at the end of the
summit will lead to ultimate resolution of the conflict.
With the restoration of mutual confidence among the
Gulf countries, Turkey stands ready to further develop
the institutional cooperation with the GCC of which
Turkey is a strategic partner.”
With President Trump’s Administration ending on
20th January, 2021, the GCC countries are apprehensive
about the incoming Joe Biden Administration’s revised
policy on Iran and growing concern about Iran’s nuclear
and missile capabilities. Iran’s announcement that it has
resumed enriching Uranium to 20% and its seizure of a
South Korean Tanker has not gone unnoticed. President
Obama’s support for the nuclear deal with Iran [JCPOA]
was deeply unpopular, not only in Israel but also in the
Gulf countries. Iran and her military proxies in Lebanon,
Iraq, Syria and Yemen are viewed as security threats to
the GCC.</b>

                         2020
Last year was a turbulent year for the whole world.
Apart from the COVID pandemic which has caused
death, disruption and economic pain for all countries,
West Asia also had to endure the added problem of low
oil prices, reduced revenues, heightened tension with
Iran, continuing civil war in Libya, Syria and Yemen,
a massive bomb blast in Lebanon’s capita Beirut’s
port that triggered a massive civil unrest, forcing the
incumbent government to resign, assassination of
important Iranian personalities and the historic step of
establishment of diplomatic ties by three Arab countries
- UAE, Bahrain and Morocco - with Israel.These were
significant events that marked the passage of 2020. It
was, indeed, a difficult year for most countries in West
Asia.</b>

                         Iran
The year began with the assassination of Qasem
Soleimani, the powerful Iranian commander of Iran’s
Revolutionary Guards’ Al-Quds Force [Jerusalem is Al-
Quds in Arabic], while he was on a visit to Baghdad. An
American armed drone, tracking Soleimani, launched a
missile strike on his convoy, as it left the airport. Also
killed was Jamal Jafaar Mohammed Ali Ebrahimi, alias
Mahdi al-Muhandis, an Iraqi military commander who
headed the Popular Mobilisation Committee [PBC] (Al-
Hashd Al-Sha'abi in Arabic) who was accompanying
Soleimani. The PBC coordinates military operations
with Iran against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
[ISIS] also referred to in the Arab world as Daesh, the
Arabic acronym from Al-Dawla Al-Islamiya fil-Iraq wa
As-Sham, translated as “Islamic State in Iraq and Syria”
[or the Levant]. As-Sham is ancient Arab name for the
region that covers Syria, Lebanon and parts of Iraq.
President Trump claimed credit for the assassination,
blaming Soleimani for planning imminent attacks on
American diplomats and military installations.</b>
                        </p>
						<p class="excert"><b>
                         Fears of an armed conflict breaking out in the region
and jeopardizing oil and gas supplies put the rest of the
world on tenterhooks. 25% of the world’s oil supplies
and almost 1/3rd of the global gas supply flow via the
strategic chokepoint of the strait of Hormuz which
connects the Gulf to the Arabian Sea. To tighten the
squeeze on Iran, the Trump Administration imposed
additional sanctions and the latter salvaged its pride by
launching attacks on two American military bases in
Iraq. Fortunately, no Americans died and Iran did not
escalate further. President Trump issued several threats
via Tweets and Iran denied that it had to do anything
with the missile attacks on the American military bases
in Iraq, known as the Green Zone. American sanctions
have devastated the Iranian economy. Oil exports hit
rock bottom and the Iranian currency fell drastically in
value. Iran cannot afford a conflict but will continue to
spar with the USA.
The year ended with another severe blow for Iran
when their top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was
assassinated in mysterious circumstances. Predictably,
the Iranian leadership pointed the finger of suspicion at
Israel. The assassination ignited fears of another round
of proxy war between the two countries which have been
sworn enemies, ever since the mullahs took over power
in Tehran, after the 1979 Iranian revolution. Both the
USA and Israel have strenuously opposed Iran’s nuclear
programme and put in place plans to stop Iran from
acquiring nuclear weapons by any means, though the
Trump Administration held back on launching strikes
on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Both Israel and the USA have
been monitoring Iran’s nuclear programme after the
Trump Administration abandoned the nuclear deal, the
JCPOA, in 2018. Biden has already indicated a policy
preference on JCPOA by naming Antony Blinken, a
strong supporter of the JCPOA, as the incoming US
Secretary of State. Israel has no interest in the revival
of the JCPOA and this assassination can be seen as
creating hurdles for the new Biden Administration to
re-join the JCPOA.</b>
                        </p>
						<p class="excert"><b>
                         Israel had staunchly opposed the JCPOA which,
according to Israel, had merely postponed Iran’s march
towards nuclear weapon capability. Iran must be hoping
that the Biden Administration will live up to its declared
campaign promise of reviving the JCPOA. Iran refrained
from any retaliatory knee-jerk mode and has already
declared that it will not fall into any such trap. Iran has
to deal with domestic public opinion that is questioning
its leadership about the hollowness of its superior
intelligence capabilities. Iran has vowed to increase
activity on its nuclear programme which has reached a
stage, where it is not dependent on one scientist. Iran’s
domestic situation has also been difficult with large scale
uprising against high prices and tough living conditions
for the common people. The Iranian regimes heavy hand
in quelling the uprisings led to thousands of deaths. Iran
has since raised production of Low Enriched Uranium
[LEU], a vital ingredient in nuclear power generation
and nuclear weapons, much above the limit prescribed
by the JCPOA. Iran has always maintained that as a
signatory to the NPT, its nuclear programme is entirely
peaceful and its leadership has affirmed that Iran shall
never produce such weapons, a claim that no one has
ever believed.</b>

                         Lebanon
The explosion at Beirut port on 4th August,
2020, caused by illegally stored ammonium nitrate,
was another devastating blow in West Asia. The explosion destroyed the warehouse and adjoining old
neighbourhoods, killing over 200 people and rendering
over 2 lakhs homeless. A nation of 6.1 million on the
Mediterranean, bordering Israel to the South and Syria
to the East and North, Lebanon has a bewildering
variety of religious sects and large groups of Syrian and
Palestinian refugees. By its Constitutional provision, the
President is a Maronite Christian, the Speaker a Shia
Muslim and the PM a Sunni Muslim. Parliamentary
seats are apportioned to various Christian groups like
the Maronite Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Melkite
Christian, Armenian Orthodox, Armenian Catholic,
Protestant and other Christian Sects. Among Muslims,
seats are apportioned for Sunnis, Shias, Alawite and
Druze. This division of seats in Parliament was agreed
by all parties after the Taif Agreement in 1989 which
ended the Civil War that started in 1975. Lebanon has
long suffered from internal conflict because of a large
Palestinian refugee community from Israel which tilted
the sectarian balance in favour of the Muslims. The
Shia militant group Hezbollah, supported by Iran, has
regularly clashed with the Israeli military across the
border.</b>

                         The Beirut port explosion triggered a mass civil
unrest in a country already torn by sectarian politics.
The Lebanese have become increasingly frustrated
with this sectarian system and have demanded a meritbased
technocratic system. The Beirut explosion and its
aftermath led to the PM resigning and a hastily cobbled
government took over. The economy, already stressed
by various factors, collapsed. The Lebanese currency
lost 80% of its value, unemployment skyrocketed
and the Lebanese started seeking refuge in Europe.
Lebanon’s economic problems have been exacerbated
by unsustainable government debt and inability to carry
our economic reforms that has made it the third most
indebted state in the world. Rampant corruption has
led to siphoning of funds from state coffers. Lebanon’s
exports were a mere USD 3 billion in 2019.</b>

The civil war in Syria and the rise of the ISIS and
the eventual destruction of the latter, has devastated
Syria for nine long years. The economy has collapsed
and infrastructure destroyed. Syrian business suffered
huge losses when Lebanon’s economy collapsed since
Lebanese banks had substantial investment from Syria.
President Bashar Al-Assad’s government has long been
the target of regime change by the USA and its Western
and Arab allies. Russia and China have propped up
Assad. American sanctions and support for Syrian
rebel militias have fuelled the civil war and prevented
international funds from being invested in reconstruction
of infrastructure in Syria. Sanctions have been used as
the tool to leverage Western objectives of pressurizing
the Assad government to release political prisoners and
initiate political reforms. Syria is still in shambles and
the ordinary people are facing hardships, that seem
unlikely to end soon. The Assad regime has clung on to
power with the help of Russia and Iran and the badly
needed reconstruction effort may see a positive trend

though under pressure from corruption charges, will be
able to use the peace deals with Arab countries to good
use in the forthcoming elections. The Palestinians have
nothing to cheer for, as Israel broke free from decades

the UAE but the humanitarian situation remained grim.
In other countries of West Asia and Arabic-speaking
North Africa tensions and turbulence prevailed. Popular

The transition to a relatively stable democracy in Tunisia,

place seems the most advanced and in Sudan the political transition underway also looks promising. In civil war
afflicted Libya, the contestants with some help from the
external actors have agreed to a permanent ceasefire
and formation of transitional authority to pave the way
forward while in the Eastern Mediterranean, witnessed
the rise of contestation between Egypt, Turkey, and the
EU. The older monarchies and sheikhdoms are coming

India’s low-reaction to the assassinations led to
allegations that India was siding with the USA and
Israel, though Trump’s trashing of the JCPOA and oil
and financial sanctions impacted on India-Iran ties.
India was forced to reduce oil imports to zero from one
of its leading suppliers. Financial sanctions also deterred
many Indian companies from doing business with Iran.
Hence, India would prefer removal of these sanctions.
Sanctions on Iran are directly linked to the rejuvenation
of the JCPOA with American participation. Iran-USA
negotiations on this issue, when it happens, will be long
drawn, complex and difficult, because it will hinge on
Iran’s willingness to return to the restrictions imposed
by the JCPOA and the Biden Administration’s flexibility

and gas to India respectively. Having nurtured good ties
with all GCC countries, the intra-GCC reconciliation
will facilitate India’s economic recovery as these
countries are major trading and investment partners
and employment destinations for Indian workers. With
UAE, Bahrain and Morocco establishing full diplomatic
ties with Israel, India will have reason to be satisfied,
given the close security ties India has developed with
Israel. Recent visits by India’s External Affairs’ Minister
to Qatar and the visit of the Chief of Army Staff to
Saudi Arabia and UAE underscored this trend. Earlier
the Defence Minister visited Russia and Iran. India’s
multifaceted bilateral relationship in areas such as
energy, trade, investment, food processing, healthcare,
education, culture, defence and security are set to
expand in the region.</b>

                         While the USA remains the most influential external
power in West Asia, Russia, China and Turkey have
increased their influence in the region. Russia has become
the major external power in Syria and Libya. China has
used its BRI and financial muscle to sign a deal with
Iran for USD 400 billion in strategic investments. While
the amount may be fanciful, it does presage China’s
intention to play a role in the region by leveraging
the economic route. China’s expansionist agenda and
“Wolf Warrior” diplomacy has gone hand-in-hand with
its economic outreach.</b>
