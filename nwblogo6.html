						COVID-19 and the measures to prevent its spread
brought about most unprecedented public health and
socio-economic crisis in our lifetime. It affected us all,
but more discomforts and disturbances reached the
vulnerable populations. Healthwise, most vulnerable are
the aged sixty plus with morbidities. On the economic
front, most vulnerable are the people engaged in the
informal sectors and in small trade and commerce.</b>

As the fallout from the corona virus pandemic comes
into sharper focus, the position of the small businesses
appears particularly bleak. Some small businesses,
such as accommodations, cooked food service, and
educational services, childhood-education centres,
sports classes, art schools , hair dressing and beauty
care, all modes of passenger transports , taxi, rickshaws
and hired car services have been severely affected by changed customer behaviour owing to the physical
distancing and mandated operational restrictions. Some
small businesses in the healthcare sector—including
ambulatory care (such as dentists’ offices) and small
private practices that patients may be reluctant to visit in
person—are also highly affected. These and many other
small businesses may close because of the prolonged
uncertainty in their operations and ongoing financial
crisis. The most vulnerable small businesses face both
financial and COVID-related challenges.</b>

                         In India more than 110 million people are employed by
country’s 63 million micro, small and medium enterprises
(MSMEs). It is the second largest employment generator
after agriculture. Indian MSMEs produce more than
6,000 products for local and global consumption.
According to DGCIS data, the value of MSME related
products in India is $147.39 billion and contributed
48.56% of total export during 2017-18. Data from
2019 shows that sector contributed 29% to overall GDP.
MSME becomes more important with government’s new
mission of achieving $5 trillion economy target by 2025.</b>

						<p class="excert"><b>
						Within this target the role of MSME sector is going play
an important role, with expected contribution to GDP
above 50% mark.
The announcement of country wide lockdown dragged
MSME owners, employers and external stakeholders in
unexpected times, have had negative impact on supply
of finished goods, procurement of raw material and
availability of employees to work in production and
supply processes, debt repayments, wages/salaries,
statutory dues, etc. As it appears, a substantial section
of MSMEs in India may default on debt under the
emerging scenario of an extended lockdown — but
each sector will face different challenges. Businesses
in the consumer and retail sector are expected to see
a noteworthy drop in output. This expected drop is
due to disruption in raw material supplies from China
and other impacted countries, production shutdown,
cashflow constraints, and reduced economic activity due
to shop closures. In the manufacturing sector — which
includes electronics, textiles, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles — output is expected to drop considerably.
This drop is largely driven by a high dependence on
China for raw materials, halting of production, and
lower demand, especially in the auto industry. Across
every sector, these business disruptions leave millions of
people at risk of losing their livelihoods if MSMEs are
unable to adapt and build resilience fast. Ambiguity in
future trade and bounce back of new normal is keeping
financial institutions at bay for extending any new
financial lending or cover potential risk. This all-round
uncertainty needed a push by government, to boost
market confidence and bring back regular cash flow in
economy. MSMEs present in remote areas also faced lots
of difficulties due to interrupted supply chain systems
and intrastate lockdown provisions. consumers are left
with lower disposable income. Many enterprises laidoff
their workers because of inability to pay salaries,
vacated their offices due to incurring expenses and
halted their production due to stopped demand.</b>

Enterprises working in essential commodity business
were better off in terms of interrupted but predictable cash flows. Some enterprises innovated their ways by
shifting focus from non-essential commodities towards
essential commodities; like production of hand sanitizer
and toiletries, PPE kits, reusable masks, etc. and are
able to survive in tough times.
The Atmanirbhar Bharat Mission (ABM) was launched
to face two burning issues simultaneously; one being
boost to MSMEs and other being less dependent upon
foreign nations. Out of 15 relief measures declared
under this package, 6 were entirely focused to empower
MSMEs. These 6 measures are: Definition level change
for MSME: Credit and Finance Scheme, Allocating
Fund of Funds for Equity Participation, Relief in
Non-Performing Asset, clearing off dues to MSMEs,
Disallowing Global Tenders. It is not known how
much impact the ABM created as far as West Bengal is
concerned where 14% of India’s MSMEs are located.</b>

                         With this backdrop in mind, the Institute of Social and
Cultural Studies, (ISCS), India organized a research
Based Conference on “The Impact of COVID-19
on Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise in South
Bengal’s Trade, Commerce and Economy” on a hybrid
platformon 12th December 2020. The Welcome
Address to the conference was presented by Sri Arindam
Mukherjee, Director, ISCS, India. The Guest of Honor
was Dr. K. Rangarajan, Professor and Head, Centre
for MSME Studies, Kolkata Campus, Indian Institute
for Foreign Trade. Sri Gautam De, Regional Director,
RTC, ICCR, Kolkata was the Distinguished Guest.
The Key Note Speaker was Professor Rajagopal Dhar
Chakraborti, former Director IISWBM, Kolkata. Sri
Arindam Mukherjee articulated that the severity of the
problem related to Covid 19 induced the Institute to
enlarge its scope of activities to the field of public health
and economics. Sri Gautam De narrated the loss of selfemployed
jobs as corona virus spread. Prof Natarajan explained the linkages within the MSME and how it
suffered as Covid 19 spread. Prof Rajagopal viewed that
Covid 19 targeted the old and people with co morbidities
and its impact on the health of productive labour was
minimal. The suffering was essentially a short-term
economic downswing and would bounce back as we
have enough antibodies through herd immunity and /or
mass vaccination programs.	</b>

                         Ms Keka Sarma, Secretary General, Bharat Chamber
of Commerce observed that Southern Bengal was
massively hit by super cyclone Amphan while the whole
globe was passing through corona catastrophe . She
felt that the lockdown induced complete suspension
of most productive activities except for the essential
services. The number of labour hours lost varied across
industries and sectors but remained mostly incalculable
even though the employers continued paying their staff
partial or full salaries during this time. The industry
had to bear the brunt of fixed costs, mostly due to no
relief given on commercial usage of electricity by the
State Government. In West Bengal, Electricity charges
for commercial purposes are amongst the highest in the
country. Unlike the States of Uttar Pradesh, Telangana,
Maharashtra, Punjab, etc. She explained how the
thousands of small, units producing colourful LED
lights fitted along designs sketched on fibreglass board
in Chandannagar virtually faced closures owing to the
regulations on the imports of electronic intermediaries
from China. She suggested several measures to rejuvenate MSMEs
in South Bengal. She felt that production for defence
requirements as a part of Defence Procurement Policy
2020 and Defence Production and Export Promotion
Policy 2020is a new area of industrial activity and needs
to be explored in South Bengal. The food processing is
another opportunity open for the MSMEs, if some of
the short comings could be tackled. She also feels that
the MSMEs need to be visible on the Web to capture the
emerging markets. Under the National Infrastructure
Pipeline Project of the Government of India, the number
of internet subscribers is projected to increase from 27
persons out of 100 in 2019 to 75 out of 100 in 2025.
Data Speed is to be similarly increased from 23 Mbps
to 100 Mbps during this period. MSMEs all over West
Bengal need to actively participate in this digital growth,
she felt.
Swami Vedatitananda in his paper , Impact of lockdown
on MSMEs in Bengal, viewed that the pandemic and the
subsequent lockdown of society all over the world made
it impossible for people to interact with one another. He
thinks that entire travel and tourism sector faced serious
challenges. Wherever automation and IT integration are
possible, the sectors have managed to survive and pull
on. He feels that the IT companies which cater to health
sector, banking & finance sector, and those engaged
in providing statutory compliances support to other
enterprises have done good business. But IT companies
which worked for the hospitality sector are on the verge
of collapse.</b>
                        </p>
						
						<p class="excert"><b>
                         MSMEs which are labor intensive have suffered the
most. There was unprecedented migration of labor as
a consequence of lockdown. People who had picked up
valuable skills moved away from the production line on
COVID-19 fatality apprehensions. Lots of people who
migrated to other states returned to their families in West
Bengal with no sustainable livelihood. Cash flow was
another constraint for local MSMEs, whatever reserves
they have had all gone with committed expenditures.
He thinks a complete loan waiver can only save these
employment providing units. Cost of doing business
has increased exponentially due to lockdown. The new
health and safety compliances have added to the cost.
In the education sector, most institutes have gone
online. This online mode can at best be a supplement to
physically attending schools and colleges. It can never
completely replace it; especially when it comes to any
technical education such as engineering or medicine. The
author thinks that this period may go down in history as
one of the greatest disruptions on the informal economy
and governmental interventions are must to ease out the
crisis.</b>

						<p class="excert"><b>
                         Dr Bhaskar Goswami, Associate Professor, Department
of Economics, University of Burdwan views the crisis
as twofold: one is the crisis resulting from the health
pandemic and the other is the economic crisis as a
manifestation of COVID pandemic. The speed of the spread of this contagious coronavirus has been too
fast to be brought under any intervening measures.
Moreover, shocks were on both the demand and the
supply side making solutions within reach. He felt that
the MSMEs were in healthy shape till 2016 but three
exogenous factors -demonetization, the GST regime
and the Covid 19, all came in a sequence to shake the
very survival roots of the MSMEs. Only time can tell
whether MSMEs can survive in a formal economy with
stiff competition from the large business houses. Prof. Jyotish Prakash Basu, Professor of Economics,
Dept. of Economics, West Bengal State University,
Barasat, Kolkata, in his paper , Impact of COVID-19
on MSME in South West Bengal viewed that India’s
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) is
largest in the world after China. MSMEs fostered
rural industrialization , reduced regional imbalances,
provided huge employment and acting as the ancillary
units of the large industries , contributed significantly
to the socioeconomic development in India. This paper
concentrated on the traditional crafts of West Bengal.
There are many deprived social groups like scheduled
caste and scheduled tribe, women, landless and informal
workers involved in the manufacturing of indigenous
products like baluchuri, silk, handloom, katha stitch
saree, terracotta, brass ,bell metals dokra crafts ,pottery,
bamboo works ,woollen doll etc. of South West Bengal.</b>

						<p class="excert"><b>
                         The unorganized manufacturing enterprises in West
Bengal accounts for 21.25 % of all unorganized
manufacturing enterprises in India in 2015-16.
The author finds highest numbers of artisans in the
Mat industry followed by needle craft, cane/ bamboo,
sheel carving, brass % metals, pottery etc. He too
finds problem like low liquidity or crunch of cash flows
and lack of workforce as daily-wage earners shifted to
their villages. The paper mentions ‘Pottery activity’,
Beekeeping Activity’ and Agarbati Making project’
under Graminodyog Vikas Yojana(GVY) scheme. The
objectives of these schemes are to enhance the capacity
building of the artisans and workforce involved. The
appropriate implementation of such schemes may
achieve self-Reliant India or Atmanirbhar Bharat, he
thinks.</b>

                         Sreerupa Ray, Assistant Professor of Economics,
Krishnagar Government College made an analysis of
the Covid-19 Pandemic Crisis over the Cutlery Cluster
of Jhalda, Tassar Silk Cluster of Raghunathpur and the
Handloom Cluster of Santipur. Her findings are: most
of the MSMEs operate outside the formal network, the
units rarely maintain accounts, pay taxes or adhere to regulatory norms.; credit funding generally comes
from informal source; revenue dropped while costs of
production increased sharply; capacity utilization was
very low; digitalization of production or sales was
very low despite the use of smart phones. She suggests
immediate governmental intervention as way out. The
conference later remarked as a very significant event
by the multi-sectoral audiences who believed that the
in-depth discussion on the situation various policy
approach, strategies and pedagogy towards mitigating
the bits of COVID-19 on the future attributes of
