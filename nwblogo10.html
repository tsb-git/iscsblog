						Myanmar since its independence had witnessed
prolonged military rule. In a country where the legacy
of the armed forces is associated with the national
liberation movement expanded its dominance in the
political arena by 1958 and thereafter establishing its
full control after the democratically elected government
of Prime Minister U Nu was overthrown by General
Ne Win in 1962 on charges of failing to control
ethnic insurgency, corruption and administrative
mismanagement. Since then Myanmar had seen direct
military rule, constitutional military directorship and an
endeavor towards democratic reforms which exhibited
significant success after Suu Kyi was released from
her house imprisonment and her party the National
League for Democracy (NLD) was allowed to contest
the election and form the government in 2015. The
critical balance between the civil and the military
leadership of Myanmar thus faced severe crisis after the
general election of November 2020 where the ruling
party National League of Democracy registered an
astounding victory defeating the pro military Union
Solidarity Development party. The army disputed the
results, claiming that the vote was fraudulent which
according to some political experts was the driving
force that led the military leadership to orchestrate a
coup and establish its firm grip on the political power
of the country.</b>
                         </p>
						 <p class="excert"><b>
						 Institute of Social and Cultural Studies India as a part
of its multidisciplinary endeavor organized a webinar
comprising distinguished scholars on Myanmar to carry
out an academic inquest to understand the implication
of the recent military coup in determining the future
of Indo- Myanmar relations and shaping the security
scenario of the Indo- Pacific region.
This significant webinar was moderated by
Ambassador Rajib Bhatia, Former Ambassador of India
to Myanmar, Mr. Pratim Ranjan Bose, Researcher and
Columnist, Mr. Mohit Mutsuddhi, Research Associate,
Delhi Policy Group, Mr. Suraj Langpoklakpam,
Associate Professor, Department of Political Science
and International Relations, Dhanamanjuri University,
Imphal, Manipur.</b>
                         </p>
						 <p class="excert"><b>
						 Ambassador Rajib Bhatia commenced his introductory
deliberation by highlighting the significance of the
present issue. Briefly narrating the political history of
Myanmar he stressed the necessity to understand the
plethora of internal and external dimensions that might
have played a role in this military coup.
He thereafter requested the first speaker of the Webinar
Mr. Mohit Mutsuddhi to put forward his presentation.
Shri Mutsuddhi said that the slow and thoughtful transition of Myanmar towards democracy received a
major setback after the countryâ€™s military leadership
staged a sudden coup to remove the elected civilian
government from power. In his address he presented few
probable reasons like the alleged electoral malpractices
by the ruling National League for Democracy (NLA),
political aspiration of the Myanmar powerful military
chief Min Aung Hlaing behind the current military
action.
As political uncertainty looms large in Myanmar,
the role of this immediate powerful neighbour China
cannot be overlooked. The speaker subsequently in his
discourse analyzed the crucial dynamics of the Sino-
Indian relations and how it is going to get shaped in
the post coup scenario. According to him China by
building strong economic, political and military ties with
Myanmar has been gradually increasing its influence
within this Southeast Asian nation.</b>
                         </p>
						 <p class="excert"><b>
						 The distinguished scholar while narrating the
gradual evolution of Sino- Myanmar relation also
raised suspicion of a covert Chinese patronage behind
the recent military coup. He opined that though the
western powers like United States of America, Australia
and international organizations like the United Nations
and members of United Nation Security Council had
registered their formal protest against such undemocratic
act and threatened economic sanctions over Myanmar
yet according to the eminent panelist the efficacy of such
sanctions at present seemed to be very limited.
The last part of his deliberation centered round
about the probable Indian response towards this recent
military coup. According to the speaker India has close
economic and military cooperation with Myanmar
and hoped that it would pursue the policy which aims
towards a more stable and participatory order in this
important South-East Asian nation.</b>
                         </p>
						 <p class="excert"><b>
						 The next speaker Prof Suraj Langpoklakpam during
his deliberation not only discussed India- Myanmar
relation from a general perspective but also from the
perspective of a North East Indian. He commenced his
discussion by stating how Aung San Suu Kyiâ€™s desire to
reform the Army and Myanmar constitution may have
triggered the recent military coup. In the subsequent
part of his discussion the speaker narrated about the
close political relationship that both India and Myanmar
enjoyed since their independence, highlighting how
India helped the Thakin Nu government in its effort
to suppress the communist uprising. He also pointed
to the close association between the two nations in the
non alignment movement and the cordial relationship
maintained by the successive military regimes of
Myanmar.
Mentioning Prime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s visit
to Myanmar in 2014, where India unveiled his new
Act East Policy the distinguished speaker explained the
policy initiatives taken by the present government of
India to build closer connectivity, economic cooperation
and mutual assistance in combating emerging security
threats with the neighbouring Myanmar.
The second important part of his deliberation centered
round the place of north east India in the discourse of
Indo- Myanmar relationship. He stated that the north
eastern states of India enjoy a natural relationship with
Myanmar as both share a long international border
between them. In the due course of his discussion he
stated that the Indian government initiative to open up
the north eastern Indian border to facilitate easy trade
between India and Myanmar raised hope among the
residents of north east India however he also stated about
the growing disappointment among the people of north
east India due to the prolong delay in implementation of
a smooth cross border trade between the two countries
via north east India. He urged that the Myanmar policy
of the Indian government should not be seen from a mere
security point of view and demanded a more inclusive
policy by incorporating the demands and aspirations of
the local north East Indian people.</b>
                         </p>
						 <p class="excert"><b>
						 In the course of his discussion he not only pointed
out the ever increasing Chinese influence in Myanmar
but also revealed the uneasy relationship it had with
Myanmar's civilian government and surmised a possible
Chinese role behind the military coup.
At the end of the deliberation stating Indiaâ€™s close
military and economic interest are with Myanmar he
opined that India should take a pragmatic policy that
suited its national interest.
The last speaker of the webinar Shri Pratim Ranjan
Bose confined his deliberation on the economic aspects
of the Indo- Myanmar relation. He commenced his
discussion by briefly stating the post coup situation in
Myanmar and highlighted the probable reason behind
the present military coup.
Commenting on the close economic cooperation
between the two countries he stated the significant
investment made by India in Myanmarâ€™s education,
agriculture pharmaceuticals and information technology
sector. He opined that India should follow a pragmatic
policy and maintain a stable relation with the military
regime of Myanmar that enjoys significant dominance in the socio- political system of the country. According
to the speaker though Indiaâ€™s trade share with Myanmar
has seen a decreasing trend over the few years yet
recently Indian corporations has shown keen interest
in investing in Myanmar. He believed that in the field
like electricity generation India should cooperate more
closely with Myanmar. In his presentation he urged the
Indian government for initiating a concessional trade
agreement with Myanmar, fast tracking the bilateral
border trade and finally increasing Indiaâ€™s presence in
Myanmar economic sphere.</b>
                         </p>
						 <p class="excert"><b>
						 The moderator thereafter summed up the webinar
where he stated that though India had not fully utilized
its potential in the economic sphere of Myanmar yet
India is pursuing a policy towards more close economic
cooperation with its south East Asian neighbour.
Subsequently the moderator also threw some light over
the dynamics of the Myanmar military leadership and
how it had an uneasy relationship with the civilian
government headed by Suu Kyi. He thereafter opened
the session requesting the audience to raise their
questions and place their opinion over the issue. During
the question answer session important questions were
raised like what would be Myanmarâ€™s relation with
Asean, its role in BIMSTEC in the post coup scenario,
what could be the probable response of India as the non
permanent member of United Nation Security council
regarding the military takeover and how the power
structure and the aspiration of Myanmarâ€™s military
leadership would determine the political destiny of
the nation in future. The questions were adequately
answered by the distinguished speakers.</b>
                         </p>
						 <p class="excert"><b>
						 The webinar ended with the vote of thanks from Shri
Arindam Mukherjee, Director, Institute of Social and
Cultural Studies India where he thanked the moderator,
speaker and the audience for participating in this
enriching and lively discourse.</b>
