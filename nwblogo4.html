						Bangladesh got its much awaited independence on
December 16, 1971 when the joint forces of India and
the Mukti-Bahini fought together and 93,000 Pakistani
army personnel surrendered. However, by that time
the people of Bangladesh witnessed a massacre of 30
lakh people including unimaginable level of atrocities
on women and arson in the name of the infamous
Operation Searchlight by Pakistan. This massacre was
chronicled in the pages of history. Approximately one
crore hapless and war-torn people took shelter in India
then and India too extended her helping hands towards
these people. India's cooperation during those days is
a unique example of humanity and will remain so in
future.
                         </p>
						  <p class="excert">
There is a hundred -year-old proverb, "A friend in need
is a friend indeed". The horrific days of 1971 brought
under light the faces of friends and enemies to the
Bengalis. The Pakistani aggressors were in a killing spree
like a narcissist those days while India stood firmly as a friend beside the homeless, unclad , hungry people.
India provided food, clothing, shelter and protection to
more than one crore refugees during those days. Not
only India provided training and weapons to the Bengali
fighters, ignoring all the obstacles, the Indian army took
part also in the war on behalf of the Bengalis. As a
result, Bengalis got independence in just nine months
and built independent Bangladesh.
                        </p>
						
						<p class="excert">
                         During the war of independence in 1971, almost all the
powerful countries of the world opposed the creation of
Bangladesh. Not only did they stand in opposition but
also supported Pakistan by providing arms. Almost all
the bullets fired by Pakistan on the innocent Bengalis
that day were supplied by China. The "diplomatic
approach" that India did take then to support Bangladesh
is unprecedented in the history of the world. India was
one of the artisans in pressurizing the international
community and compelled Pakistan to release Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman, the Father of the Nation. The great
Bengali nation remembers with gratitude that support
and contribution of India.
India acknowledged Bangladesh as an independent state
on 6th December 1971, just before the end of the war of
liberation. On the same day, Bhutan also acknowledged
Bangladesh and for that the main artisan was India.
These two countries were first to accept Bangladesh as
an independent nation.
                        </p>
						<p class="excert">
                         Bilateral relations between Bangladesh and India is much
different than any other bilateral relationship. This
relationship is more of blood and emotion than bilateral.
The Prime Minister of India, Smt. Indira Gandhi,
extended her hand of cooperation in building a newly
independent Bangladesh. Under the leadership of Father
of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman
and Smt. Indira Gandhi, a long-term friendship and
security agreement was signed in 1972. Boddhara opined
that such an agreement was justified in the geopolitical
context of South Asia. Both countries recognized each
other's geographical boundaries, sovereignty, regional
security and economic development. When the people
of these two countries started to take their relationship
to a new height in a remarkable reaction to their history,
geography and culture, a group of anti-liberation force
brutally assassinated Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman, Father of the Nation and his family. It was on
15 August 1975. And the defeated forces of Pakistan
seized the power. After coming to power, they started
opposing India by inciting communal exhortation.
Various kinds of misdeeds started and the friendly
relationship sprouted from the combined bloodshed
in 1971 was destroyed. All the values, traditions and
civil rights of the Bengali nation were destroyed in the
steamroller of the government under military rule and
support for a long time.
Bangabandhu's daughter Sheikh Hasina came to power
after a long 21-yearsâ€™ struggle against evil forces. As
soon as she came to power, Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina started trying to restore the relationship between
the two countries and extended the hand of friendship.
One of the results of which was the historic Ganges
water sharing agreement between Bangladesh and
India in 1996. At that time, significant progress was
made in the security of Bangladesh and India. The 1997
Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord was impossible
without India's help. During that time, the relation
between the two countries started to get strengthened
by moving forward through economic development
and the establishment of new contacts. But that did not
continue for long. The conspiracy started again. As a
result, hostile relationship started developing between
the two countries. This was joined again by the antiindependence
pro-Pakistan evil forces. Sheikh Hasina
lost power in 2001 due to manipulation. Many heinous
acts took place between 2001-2006, like smuggling of
10 truckloads of arms, other various illegal smuggling
attempts at the border, bombings in 63 districts, and
grenade attacks on public gatherings in an attempt to
assassinate the then Leader of the Opposition.
                        </p>
						<p class="excert">
                         Overcoming all the disasters, Bangabandhu's daughter
Sheikh Hasina returned to power at the end of 2008. A
new context for the development of India-Bangladesh
relation was once again created. Sheikh Hasina, the
leader of the people had been in power since 2008. Her
popularity was increasing day by day. As a successful
statesman and popular world leader during her visit to
India in 2010 as the Prime Minister, she could accelerate
the relation between the two countries and economic
exchanges expanded. Sheikh Hasina governmentâ€™s
strong approach of sectarian opposition attracted the
attention of the Indians. At the same time, she strongly
suppressed the possibility of the emergence of internal
terrorism through the anti-terrorism campaign. The
anti-India forces in Bangladesh became weak. India
has a rare opportunity to control the isolation of the
northeast zone. The result is a new horizon for trade
between the two countries. Bangladesh transit facility
to northeastern India, border issues solution, import of
electricity from India, one billion dollar loan from India
to Bangladesh, joint support of Bhutan-Nepal transit
facility, exchange of enclaves, issuance of visas to 1.5
million Bangladeshis every year, such positive records can be found in the last eleven years. Additionally, India
provided 850 million US dollar in 2011 and 1 billion
US dollar in 2014 to Bangladesh. On July 26 2020,
India handed over 10 broad gauge locomotives to
Bangladesh. This is an implementation of an important
promise made by Modi government during the visit
of the Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina to
India in October 2019.
                        </p>

                         Bangladesh is the first neighboring country with
whom India has signed a vaccination agreement in the
backdrop of Covid -19 pandemic, a clear evidence of
Indiaâ€™s entrusting importance to Bangladesh. Former
Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj visited Dhaka
and said, â€˜India is the first neighbor. And Bangladesh
is the first among the neighbors.â€™ For the time being,
India will give 30 million corona vaccine to Bangladesh
on priority basis. Moreover, the two countries have
continued to co-operate in each other's needs during
this catastrophic time in Corona.
The much-anticipated virtual meeting between the
Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina and the
Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi was held on
December 17 2020. During the meeting, Bangladesh
and India signed seven Memoranda of Understanding
(MoUs) on cooperation in seven sectors including
agriculture, trade , energy , hydrocarbons, ensuring
sanctuary for elephant conservation, collaboration of
Bangabandhu Museum with New Delhi Museum, launch
of High Impact Community Development Project and
on Tripartite Agreement on Purchase of Equipment.

                         The two Prime Ministers also inaugurated the 'Bapu-
Bangabandhu Digital Exhibition featuring Mahatma
Gandhi and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
Indian Prime Minister Modi remarked, "Mahatma
and Bangabandhu are the inspiration of our youth."
International experts believe that this respect of the
Indian Government towards Bangabandhu will go a
long way in India-Bangladesh relations. In addition,
the two Prime Ministers formally inaugurated the
Chilahati-Haldibari rail link project. If this project is
implemented, the communication of Bangladesh with
North Bengal will be much easier. Today, the Birth Centenary of the Father of the Nation
is being celebrated in independent Bangladesh. The 50
years of Bangladesh-India bilateral relation will also be
celebrated. The test of this long 50-years relationship
has made Bangladesh-India friendship even brighter.
Today, both the countries are calling this chapter
of India-Bangladesh relation as the "Golden Age".
The expectation of the future will be more and more
stronger relation between the two friendly countries.
It is expected that the two countries will expand their
cooperation in various fields including Border security,
Blue-economy, Space Research, Cyber Security and
Economic Cooperation. They will always be by each
other's side as in the past.
