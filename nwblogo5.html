						2021 is special. Special because with vaccines in the
horizon, the world is foreseeing freedom from the grip
of COVID-19 in 2021. For Bangladesh the year is more
so, as it is the year when we celebrate simultaneously
our golden jubilee and birth centenary of Father of
the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
After the colorful inauguration on January 10, 2020
coinciding with Bangabandhu’s home coming day
from Pakistan prison in 1971, the long awaited birth
centenary celebration of Bangabandhu faced an abrupt
halt as the first cases of COVID-19 were reported from
Bangladesh in mid-March last year. Now Bangladesh is
ready to celebrate not only its ‘50’, but also preparing
to celebrate lots more. This is the year when we are
expecting Metro Rail to ‘FLY’ across the horizon
of Dhaka city and vehicles ‘diving’ deep beneath the
depth of the Karnaphuli river. It is also when the once
invincible mighty Padma, representing the aspirations
as well as the challenges of Bangladesh, will see vehicles
and trains ‘sailing’ across its vastness.
‘At 50’ Bangladesh eyes on becoming a developed nation
by 2041 and aspires joining the Elite club of top 25
economies of the world much earlier, a little more than
a decade from now, overtaking economic giants like
Singapore, Hong Kong, UAE, Denmark and Sweden to
name a few. And finally having secured a prestigious
position in the top twenty list of world’s safest places for
COVID-19, in a list published recently by Bloomberg,
we are now foreseeing yet another great victory, with
Indian collaboration, against COVID-19, as we are
primarily depending on ‘Covishield’ from Indian Serum
Institute, a savior from the notorious virus. This makes
us nostalgic of the events 50 years back when our two
great nations joined hands to crush the mighty Pakistan
military machinery in the marshes of Bangladesh.</b>
                         </p>
						  <p class="excert"><b>
In fact, the achievements of Bangladesh ‘at 50’ are so
diversified and plentiful that even the most hardcore
activist of the ruling Bangladesh Awami League will find
it impossible to list the multi-dimensional achievements of the country in the last decade. Having said so, on
the contrary, it is also true that the answer will be not
so difficult if we question whether Bangladesh has met
the expectations of its liberation - a secular Bangladesh
in the spirit of 1971, visioned by Bangabandhu Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman. That answer will not be so difficult
as it’s only two alphabets - it’s a ‘No.’ The recent
statements by some ‘traders of religion’ threatening
to throw Bangabandhu’s sculpture in the Buriganga
river and immediate execution of such threats by their
disciples vandalizing Bangabandhu’s and BaghaJatin’s
sculptures bear testimony to this statement. But if we
ask why, that explanation once again will become a long
one with many ‘buts’ and ‘ifs’. It has become a fashion
these days to blame Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and
Bangladesh Awamy League whenever a sculpture is
vandalized or Hindu interest is unserved. Interestingly
we see the same phenomenon across our borders where
as the saying in Bengali goes, ‘it’s Nanda Ghosh who
is always to be blamed’, meaning whoever may be at
fault, the fictitious character called ‘Nanda Ghosh’, is
to be blamed. No matter whatever the background, it
is customary to blame Prime Minister Narendra Modi
and BJP, whenever minority rights are violated in any
corner of the vast country.</b>

                         We intellectuals in Bangladesh, in our writings and
speeches often refer to the secular and non-communal
heritage of Bangladesh dating back thousand years,
which of course is not at all untrue. It is in this land
where Chandi Das in the middle ages said, “mankind
is above all and nothing is beyond”.It is also true that
this is the territory where, whether under occupation
or liberation, communalism and communal forces have
received unhindered state sponsored patronization for
more than two centuries, with the exception of three
and half years under Bangabandhu and little more than
a decade and half under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
and that too with multiple breaks of variable durations
in between.
‘Banga Bhanga’ by the British Raj was in no way with
any good intention of upliftment of the Bengali nation.
It was rather to sow the seeds of hatred deep into the
Bengali society and inject the psyche of Bengali Muslims
and Hindus with the thought that they had to survive
through competition and not collaboration; that they
were competitors and not brothers. The consequences
were devastating and farfetched. “Hatmey biri mu mey
paan, larkey lengey Pakistan” slogan was chanted by
the Bengalis in the streets of Dhaka in 1947 and not in
Lahore or Karachi. Therefore the journey of secularism
and progressive thinking in occupied East Pakistan and
again in liberated Bangladesh under Bangabandhu’s
leadership was not all easy.
After Awami Muslim League was founded with young
Sheikh Mujib, the future Bangabandhu as the senior
Joint Secretary of the party in the newly formed East
Pakistan, he did not like to see the ‘Muslim’ word
added to the party’s name, but was undone assessing
the ground realities prevailing in the then East Pakistan.
This he mentioned when he penned down his memories.
It took Bangabandhu almost a decade to rename Awami
Muslim League as Awami League.
East Pakistan - the name imposed on today’s Bangladesh
after partition of undivided India, bears testimony to
the policy of the Pakistanis towards the Bengali nation.
It was an attempt to make the Bengali nation forget
their identity and similar examples were plentiful in the
history of Bangladesh under Pakistani occupation of 24
years. The arrogant Mohammad Ali Jinnah declared
as early as in 1948 in Dhaka that Urdu would be the
one and only state language of Pakistan, with sheer
ignorance to the mother tongue of the majority citizens
of the country, which was Bengali. The Pakistanis also
tried to abolish Bengali alphabets and introduce Arabic
alphabets instead for writing Bengali and there had also
been attempts of ‘Islamization’ of literary works not only
by Rabindranath Tagore, but also those by Kazi Nazrul
Islam. It will, however, be a major mistake to assume
that the Pakistanis had tried to accomplish all their evil
objectives on their own. There was active contribution
from their local collaborators and sympathizers, that
they and before them the British had nurtured for so
long.</b>
                        </p>
                        <p class="excert"><b>
						Referring to the much talked about general election
of 1970, where Awami League bagged 167 out of 169
parliamentary seats allocated for the central parliament
to East Pakistan where Sheikh Mujibur Rahman
emerging as the leader of the single majority party in
house and aspirant to central Prime Ministership, it is a
fact that even in those polls more than 30% Bengalis did
not vote for Awami League. Not only so, the barbaric
crimes against humanity committed in occupied
Bangladesh during our liberation war in 1971, where
three million Bangladeshis perished over a brief period
of nine months making the Pakistanis ‘champions
of genocide in the recorded history of mankind’, was
also not possible without active contribution of their
local collaborators. The Pakistanis intended to create a
mixed race in post-war Bangladesh, the reason why the
Pakistan military men were encouraged to rape the local
women irrespective of age and religion and there too the locals had significant role to play. Finally, the genocide
of intellectuals only 48 hours before the shameless
surrender by more than ninety thousand Pakistani
servicemen in broad daylight in the then race course in
the heart of Dhaka city at the Joint Bangladesh-India
Command, was orchestrated and executed entirely by
the locals with the Pakistan Army in the background.
These so called Bangladeshis, rather ‘expatriate
Pakistanis’ bearing the green Bangladesh passport, as I
like to label them, have not only prevailed, but rather
flourished keeping close proximity to the centre of
power in Bangladesh, following the brutal assassination
of Bangabandhu on August 15, 1975 - a date also very
carefully chosen by the pro-Pakistani local-international
axis to stage the coup. It is therefore simple mathematics
that there are not less than forty to fifty million ‘so called’
Bangladeshis in today’s Bangladesh united under diverse
political umbrellas like, Bangladesh Nationalist Party,
Jamat E Islam Bangladesh, Hefazat E Islam to name a
few, who not only dislike anything that is in the common
interest of Indo-Bangladesh ties, but also literally hate
any such issue and idea, name it secularism, democracy,
cooperation, progressive thinking – anything!!</b>
                         </p>
						  <p class="excert"><b>
Not only that, no stone has been left unturned to ensure
distortion of history. Joy Bangla was replaced overnight
with Bangladesh Zindabad and Bangladesh Betar was
renamed as Radio Bangladesh. A military Major was
placed in our history in a major way and as the one to
have proclaimed the country’s independence thus not
only just undermining Bangabandhu, but also reducing
the long struggle and aspirations of the Bengali people
for liberation to a military affair of brief duration. A
foreign ruler named Nawab Sirajuddoula was portrayed
as the last independent ruler of Bengal, despite the
fact that this gentleman could neither read nor write
Bengali, only to disprove that Bangabandhu was the
first independent Bengali ruler of the independent land
of the Bengali people in history. Last but not the least,
we have even seen attempts to project a Middle Eastern
war lord Ikhtiar Uddin Mohammad Bin Bakhtiar Khilji
as the Father of the Nation of Bangladesh.
Besides there are cross border elements that fuel such
ideas and encourage if not more, the forces of darkness
within the 144,000 square kilometers that we call
Bangladesh today. When the Mollas’ rally in the streets
of Karachi or Islamabad protesting the hanging of war
criminals in Bangladesh, the progressive forces here,
to their utter surprise, become witness to similar State
Government backed protests in the streets of Kolkata,
where Rabindranath Tagore and Swami Vivekananda
had once thrived.</b>

                         Bangladesh took u-turn towards the right course after
Bangabandhu’s elder daughter Sheikh Hasina won a
popular election and took to office in 2009. Therefore
what we see in today’s Bangladesh occasionally at times
does in no way refer to the radicalization of liberal
Bangladeshi society representing majority of our people.
These to my understanding are rather the desperate
attempts by the pro-Pakistan elements in Bangladesh
to frustrate the growing, multi-dimensional, envious
collaboration between Bangladesh and India under the
farsighted leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
and Prime Minister NarendraModi. These forces
are now operating in survival mode foreseeing their
elimination. This is like the fading lamp which suddenly
emanates bright light before it goes off permanently.
However there is no room for satisfaction for us yet as a
dying lamp has the potential to ignite a major arson,we
have to be watchful and vigilant.
If we can oversee, these curtail times, prioritizing each
other’s mutual interests, be it onion or vaccine, having
faith in each other in the spirit of 1971, we can remain
assured that the secular fabric of Bangladesh and the
region will ultimately prevail, to the greater interest of
the friendly, secular millions in Bangladesh and India.</b>
