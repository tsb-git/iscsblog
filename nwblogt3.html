					   People in India are believers in religious rituals
and practices. According to the 2011 census,
India has 216 million residential houses . But
there are around 3.01 million places of worship. The
number is larger than the number of schools and colleges
at 2.1 million. This means that for every 70 households,
we have a temple, while one school for every 100
households. . Temples and festivals have unique place
in the country. Temples and festivals together boostup
the whole economy, prosper the business and keep
Indian economy vibrant through balanced expenditure.
Festivals integrate the economy and society into oneness
where happiness and sustainable expenditure give the
stimulus to market forces, which keep Indian economy
away from being sluggish for a long time.
Such love for temples would prompt a follower
of Max Weber’s thoughts on Hinduism as reflected
in his “Protestant Ethics and the Spirit of Capitalism”
(1905) to imagine India as a country with low levels of
economic development, with people spending most of
the energy on religious activities. Max Weber viewed
that religions that place more stress on otherworldly
asceticism and de-emphasis the material world can
hardly foster attitudes that promote Capitalism. Inspired
by this Weberian thoughts, Prof Raj Krishna coined the
term “ Hindu rate of Growth” in one of his lectures
in the late 70s to say that “...no matter what happens
to the economy the trend growth rate in India will be
3.5%”. It was later used by a few economists to link the
low growth rate of the 50s-80s period to Hindu beliefs
of salvation or other-worldly asceticism. Between the
1950s to the 1980s, the average growth of GDP during
this period was around 3.5% while per capital income
grew by a mere 1.3%
                         </p>

While there are no reliable studies and estimates
on the festival economics in India, any casual observer
on the festivals in the country can feel that festivals
foster a chain of economic activities involving common
people. These is what economic development requires.
In this paper, we would make a brief review of three
Hindu festivals- Ganesh Chaturthi, Durga Puja and
Vishwakarma Puja and see whether Indian devotion to
religion has caused any movement away from capitalistic
development as visualised by Max weber. Ganesh Chaturthi
Aside from its traditional strongholds in Maharashtra
— Pune, Mumbai, the Konkan coast — Ganesh
Chaturthi is now celebrated all over India. Celebrations
in Gujarat, Karnataka, Telangana and , Kerala are no less
than how it is celebrated in Maharashtra. Hyderabad
mandaps today host bigger idols than in Mumbai.
Ganesh festivals have now become very common in
Kolkata streets. The public festival of Ganesh Chaturthi
was initiated by the Peshwas, and later revived by Bal
Gangadhar Tilak, to foster nationalistic spirit in the
state . The festival no longer carries the original spirit
of Peshwas or Lokamanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak , the
organisers and sponsors try to out beat each other in
their devotion to the Lord or rather to display their
capabilities of organising mega shows to attract visitors.
Visitors who make a visit to the Ganesh mandaps
only agency who took the initiative to study festivals
economics in the country, the 11 days of festivity in
2015 generated all-India revenues of over Rs. 20,000
crore and it has been growing by 15 to 20 per cent yearon-
year. The 20,000 crores of 2015 should end up at Rs
50,000 crores at CAGR of 20 % .

                         While the images of the elephant god are not the
biggest chunk of the bill , for thousands of idol making
craftsmen, this is a peak time for business. Maharashtra
buys about 60 lakh idols a year. Of these, over 28
lakh are sold in Mumbai. In addition. Ganesh Idols
are available in several art format ,like paintings and
sketches over pen, clothes and art papers and , sculptures
of different materials from clay to plaster-of-Paris
(PoP) to thermocol , for which artist make significant
seasonal earnings. Creation of mandaps and lightning
of the area also cost huge money . The Mumbai region
has over 15,000 small and large Ganesh mandaps.
The decorative mandaps take long time to prepare and
create job opportunities for lakhs of seasonal workers,
electricians, and many other service providers. Trucks
and other similar transports are on demand for bringing
the idol to mandap and for immersion. Most organisers
coordinate extravagant entertainment events which
also create seasonal income to performing artists . It
also creates supplementary job opportunities for many
unemployed people, and small-time office goers who
have priesthood training in addition to the normal
priests. Organisers also hosts grand feats for most of the
days of Puja in the name of offerings to the God . This
creates employment for cooks, kitchen porters and food
caterers. The festival also provides jobs to thousands of
people, most are hired as private security guards and
volunteers, aside from the unskilled labourers who get
extra work for assisting the devout in taking their idols
for immersion.

						Most of the Puja funding is crowdsourced, that
is,donations and subscriptions from the members and
patrons and corporate sponsorship . Where corporates
are shy in investing extortions from local businessmen
also form an important source of funding. The same is
true for Durga Puja in Bengal.
Durga Puja
Like Ganesh Chaturthi, Durga Puja generates about
Rs. 25,000 crore at an estimated compound annual
growth rate (CAGR) of about 35 per cent, as estimated
by ASSOCHAM in a 2013 report. With that CAGR,
the estimated size of the economy of Durga Puja in
2020 turns out to be over Rs 2 lakh crore . This then
become 14% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of West Bengal for 2020-21 (at current prices)
estimated at Rs 14,44,174 crore. It is larger than total
receipts (excluding borrowings) for 2020-21 estimated
at Rs 1,79,905 crore and almost at per with state
government expenditure for 2020-21 estimated at Rs
2,55,677 crore. Durga Puja is not only the devotional
and cultural life of Bengal, it is also the economy of
West Bengal.
As in Ganesh Chaturthi, idol-makers, craftsmen,
decorators, caterers, priests, dhakis, small shopkeepers,
and many other service providers earn major parts of
their yearly income out of this festivity. Maharashtra’s
state GDP is more than double that of West Bengal with
2 crores more population. The informal workers have
access to income earning activities throughout the year,
in West Bengal , there are not much scope. For many
of these workers, Durga Puja is the survival. The state
administration announced that there are 37,000 Puja
committees celebrating Puja this year. The rounding
of the number indicates that the list is an estimate for
the purpose of state grants and not the actual position.
The state government provide Rs 50,000 grant to
each Durga Puja committee of the state, apart from a
50 percent waiver from CESC and the state electricity
board charges. Presuming the grant to be only 5 % of
the budgets of the puja committees, a whooping Rs
3700 crores is spent through community puja alone.
The expenditure figure would rise proportionately
as grant appears smaller in their budgets . The state
budgets on police, transport and urban development in
2020-21 was Rs 8,167 crores, Rs 6,082 crores and Rs
10,571 crores respectively.
Durga Puja creates opportunities for all sectors, more
in the unorganised sectors. Security personnel are in
demand almost in very Puja, crowd control and event
management. The Indian personal security market is
estimated at Rs 1 lakh crore as per latest industry
estimates. It is also the largest employers in India
engaging 8.9 million people in 2018. The workforce
size of this industry is more than the combined strength
of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in India. Security
companies are known for openly flouting the minimum
wages prescribed by the Union Ministry of Labour, not
to think about Puja or any similar festival bonus. As in
2017 , there were 15 million unorganised sector workers
in West Bengal, mainly in labour-intensive industries,
with construction at the forefront. Indian consumers’
market would definitely been widened had these hardworking
under- paid people been little more cared with
Puja Bonuses.
Puja means natun Jama (New dresses) and these
new dresses are produced within Bengal by 1.5 million
textile workers in the state, as per 2018 estimates the
of Department of MSME, largely sold through three
large wholesale textile markets -Hari Sha Haat in North
Kolkata, Mangla Haat in Howrah and Metiburuz .
Hand weaved clothing, particulary Sarees are produced
by the weavers in Shantipur and Fulia of Nadia district.

Newspapers reports that Kumartuli’s 700-odd artisans
received orders for Durga idols worth Rs 50 crore last
year, and Durga idols were priced between Rs 60,000
and Rs 70,000. Kumartuli typically sells to over 2,000
organising committees, whose members would turn up
in large numbers in the days preceding the puja. Idols
of varying sizes are made by Kumartolis artisans, the
majority of whom come from West Bengal’s districts of
Nadia, Howrah, East Midnapore, and North and South
24-Parganas. They normally earn between Rs 10,000
and Rs 30,000 per month at this time of year.
Apart from artisans and their assistants, the puja also
offered employment to labourers, who would land up in
Kumartuli to carry the idols to the pandals. Many of these
labourers are from the Sundarbans, Canning, Baruipur,
Joynagar and adjacent areas in South 24-Parganas.
Organising committees would pay a group of labourers
of 25-30 each, about Rs 5,000 per move to the pandals.
Kumartoli 100 such groups every year. Then there are workers who provide raw materials for the idols, like
straw, mud, bamboo, dress material, and ornaments.
These items are sourced from East and West Midnapore,
Burdwan, and North and South 24-Parganas. Bamboo
usually comes from Murshidabad and Nadia. In 2019
ornaments worth Rs 3.75 crore were used to dress the
idols.

Puja needs pandals or temporary pavilions to house
the deity. Not less than 37,00 such pavilions are to
be built this year in West Bengal during Puja . The
pandal makers to the city come from various parts of
Bengal, mainly from Paschim and Purba Medinipur,
the hub of handicraft and cottage industry, and other
districts including Nadia and North and South 24
Parganas, among others. In Medinipur alone, there are
an estimated 100 pandal-making groups, also called
decorators. Usually pandal artists and makers have
no formal training. They are landless farmers, masons,
carpenters, electricians, painters, etc who pick up the
skills of pandal making with bamboo, cloth and other
materials , artwork, painting and lighting in order to
supplement income during lean agricultural seasons.
Literary magazines still publish Puja special but gone
are craze. Puja however, has become ideal time for
new product launching and branding. Conservative
estimates suggest corporate funding of pujas are no
less than Rs 500-Rs800 crores through advertising and
sponsorship. In recent years , there has been a paradigm
shift from donations to corporate sponsorship through
exhibitions and publicity programs. Corporates find
new opportunities to launch their new products through
local level advertising and sales program. It is a perfect
opportunity for brands to try to tap the consumers. The
entire Puja duration till Diwali is used to attract new and
newer customers through print, hoarding, activation
to digital. Any brand that wants to create a bond with
West Bengal and Bengalis cannot ignore Durga Puja.
Linking with this festival is a useful strategy to enter
the market in East India , win over the new customers
and to renew ties with older ones.

Advertisement promotes purchases . People at home
also spend money on groceries, new apparels and life
style and fashion accessories . According to another
survey of ASSOCHAM in 2016, during the festive month
people spend 20 per cent more on groceries; there also
occurs a 52 per cent increase in budget apparels, about
32 percent increase on lifestyle and fashion accessories .
The survey covered consumers in age groups 24-34 and
35-45 in Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore,
Chennai, Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Lucknow and
Indore. The survey reveals that women are likely to
spend more on apparel than men, while men tend to
spend more on lifestyle accessories than women. During
Diwali, electronics, automobiles and apparel dominate
the lion’s share of business. 52 per cent of the apparel
products sales take place during this festival.
Other festival related unorganised sectors
All the festivals in India encourages the unorganised
economy in a large scale and provides massive
employment opportunities for low-skilled traditional
household manufacturing sector and small micro
entrepreneurs. Raksha Bandhan festival generates
about Rs 400 crore business and provides employment
to more than 4,000 families in Gujarat.

                         China’s onslaught on India’s festival economy
India was the largest trade partner for Chinese
products (US$70.32 billion in 2018-19 . While the
products include household items like toys, furniture,
building hardware, crackers, lighting and electric fittings,
furnishing fabric, home office stationery, electronic
appliances, consumer electronics, kitchen equipment &
appliances, gift items, the list also include many festival
related products and these are being dumped into the
Indian markets through both legal and illicit channels
at throw away prices . Majority of these items are
produced in small and micro industries in India, where
investment, technology and update skill are lacking.
Media reports reveal that 75 per cent of the colours
from China have been used during last year Holi in India.
China is also capturing the accessories, plastic products
and colour sprinkler guns at worth of Rs 18,000 crore.
ASSOCHAM survey reports that 8-10 lakh jobs ae lost
due to Chinese invasion on auspicious Holi colours.
Chinese have entered Indian markets for fire crackers
and house illuminations. It has been reported that out
of Rs 10,000 crore business of fireworks, 40 per cent of
the market is captured by Chinese firework products,
adversely affecting about 2.5 lakh Indian artisans who
earn a chunk of their total income during Diwali days.
Chinese toys are also impacting the Indian toy
industry. According to the ASSOCHAM, the Indian
market is full of Chinese toys. Nearly 40 per cent of
Indian toy companies have been closed in the last five
years, and rest 20 per cent are struggling for the break-
As per media reports, ports in Maharashtra and
Gujarat are the primary entry points for illegal Chinese
crackers entering India; it has affected the livelihood
of over 500,000 households in Sivakasi and 4,00,000
small factories in West Bengal.

                         The total COVID-19 Cases cumulated to 2,66,974
till 3rd October 2020. Most affected districts are Kolkata
with 59,197 cases, followed by North 24 Parganas
(54,182 ), Howrah (19,078) , South 24 Parganas
(18,253) and Hooghly with 13,432 cases. Total death
due to Covid 19 at 5,194 is not insignificant . Death wise
Kolkata is on top with 1,767 deaths, followed by North
24 Parganas (1,170), and Howrah (588). Interestingly,
South 24 Parganas and Hooghly reported 330 and
233 deaths respectively. The corona , however, as yet
created little impact in Jhargram and Kalimpong with
less than double digit deaths as yet.
The India GDP figures indicate economic shrinkage
by 23.9 percent in the last quarter. Given that a large
part of the economy works in the informal sector — and
the lack of robust data collection during the lockdown
— this number may still not reveal the extent to which
people’s livelihoods have been affected. While workers
across sectors have been hit , people who make a living
out of festivals like artists, craftsmen, shopkeepers,
priests, decorators, electricians , flower growers and
sellers, shopkeepers have received most of the jolt . Most
of them spend the entire year waiting for the festive
season to boost their incomes. With no possibility of a
breakthrough in corona impasse the rejuvenation of the
gig economy before Puja seems impossible. Any attempt
to promote pandal visits may trigger a new wave of the
epidemic. A festive season that would have seen pomp
and pageantry is all set to be lost in mellow, sombre
introspection for the first time in several decades .
